  description: "In the Old Kingdom, Anubis was the most important god of the dead.
    He was replaced in that role by Osiris during the Middle Kingdom (2000\u20131700
    BC). In the Roman era, which started in 30 BC, tomb paintings depict him holding
    the hand of deceased persons to guide them to Osiris.\n\r\nThe parentage of Anubis
    varied between myths, times and sources. In early mythology, he was portrayed
    as a son of Ra. In the Coffin Texts, which were written in the First Intermediate
    Period (c. 2181\u20132055 BC), Anubis is the son of either the cow goddess Hesat
    or the cat-headed Bastet. Another tradition depicted him as the son of Ra and
    Nephthys. The Greek Plutarch (c. 40\u2013120 AD) stated that Anubis was the illegitimate
    son of Nephthys and Osiris, but that he was adopted by Osiris's wife Isis"
