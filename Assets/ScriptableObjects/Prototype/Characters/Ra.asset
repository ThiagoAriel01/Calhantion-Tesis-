  description: 'The chief cultic center of Ra was Iunu "the Place of Pillars", later
    known to the Ptolemaic Kingdom as Heliopolis and today located in the suburbs
    of Cairo. He was identified with the local sun god Atum. As Atum or Atum-Ra,
    he was reckoned the first being and the originator of the Ennead ("The Nine"),
    consisting of Shu and Tefnut, Geb and Nut, Osiris, Set, Isis and Nephthys. The
    holiday of "The Receiving of Ra" was celebrated on May 26 in the Gregorian calendar.

    

    Ra''s
    local cult began to grow from roughly the Second Dynasty, establishing him as
    a sun-deity. By the Fourth Dynasty, pharaohs were seen as Ra''s manifestations
    on earth, referred to as "Sons of Ra". His worship increased massively in the
    Fifth Dynasty, when Ra became a state-deity and pharaohs had specially aligned
    pyramids, obelisks, and sun temples built in his honor. The rulers of the Fifth
    Dynasty told their followers that they were sons of Ra himself and the wife of
    the high priest of Heliopolis. These pharaohs spent much of Egypt''s money on
    sun-temples. The first Pyramid Texts began to arise, giving Ra more and more
    significance in the journey of the pharaoh through the Duat (underworld).

    

    During
    the Middle Kingdom, Ra was increasingly affiliated and combined with other chief
    deities, especially Amun and Osiris.'
