  description: "Though Sobek was worshipped in the Old Kingdom, he truly gained prominence
    in the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055\u20131650 BCE), most notably under the Twelfth
    Dynasty pharaoh, Amenemhat III. Amenemhat III had taken a particular interest
    in the Faiyum of Egypt, a region heavily associated with Sobek. Amenemhat and
    many of his dynastic contemporaries engaged in building projects to promote Sobek
    \u2013 projects that were often executed in the Faiyum. In this period, Sobek
    also underwent an important change: he was often fused with the falcon-headed
    god of divine kingship, Horus. This brought Sobek even closer with the kings
    of Egypt, thereby giving him a place of greater prominence in the Egyptian pantheon.
    The fusion added a finer level of complexity to the god's nature, as he was adopted
    into the divine triad of Horus and his two parents: Osiris and Isis.\r\n\r\nSobek
    first acquired a role as a solar deity through his connection to Horus, but this
    was further strengthened in later periods with the emergence of Sobek-Ra, a fusion
    of Sobek and Egypt's primary sun god, Ra. Sobek-Horus persisted as a figure in
    the New Kingdom (1550\u20131069 BCE), but it was not until the last dynasties
    of Egypt that Sobek-Ra gained prominence. This understanding of the god was maintained
    after the fall of Egypt's last native dynasty in Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt (c.
    332 BCE \u2013 390 CE). The prestige of both Sobek and Sobek-Ra endured in this
    time period and tributes to him attained greater prominence \u2013 both through
    the expansion of his dedicated cultic sites and a concerted scholarly effort
    to make him the subject of religious doctrine."
