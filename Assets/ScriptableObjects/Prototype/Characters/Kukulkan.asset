  description: "Kukulkan is the name of a Mesoamerican serpent deity. Prior to the
    Spanish Conquest of the Yucatan, Kukulkan was worshipped by the Yucatec Maya
    people of the Yucatan Peninsula, in what is now Mexico. The depiction of the
    Feathered Serpent is present in other cultures of Mesoamerica. Little is known
    of the mythology of this deity.\r\nAlthough heavily Mexicanised, Kukulkan has
    his origins among the Maya of the Classic Period, the War Serpent, and he has
    been identified as the Postclassic version of the Vision Serpent of Classic Maya
    art.\r\nThe cult of Kukulkan/Quetzalcoatl was the first Mesoamerican religion
    to transcend the old Classic Period linguistic and ethnic divisions. This cult
    facilitated communication and peaceful trade among peoples of many different
    social and ethnic backgrounds. Although the cult was originally centred on the
    ancient city of Chichen Itza in the modern Mexican state of Yucat\xE1n, it spread
    as far as the Guatemalan Highlands.\r\nSizeable temples to Kukulkan are found
    at archaeological sites throughout the north of the Yucat\xE1n Peninsula, such
    as Chichen Itza, Uxmal and Mayapan.\r\nKukulkan was a demon closely associated
    with the Itza state in the northern Yucat\xE1n Peninsula, where the cult formed
    the core of the state religion. Although the worshipers of Kukulkan had its origins
    in earlier Maya traditions, the Itza worship of Kukulkan was heavily influenced
    by the Quetzalcoatl cult of central Mexico.  Kukulkan headed a pantheon of deities
    of mixed Maya and non-Maya provenance, used to promote the Itza political and
    commercial agenda. It also eased the passage of Itza merchants into central Mexico
    and other non-Maya areas, promoting the Itza economy.\r\nAtChichen Itza, Kukulkan
    ceased to be the Vision Serpent that served as a messenger between the king and
    the gods and came instead to symbolise the divinity of the state.\r\nChichen
    Itza served as a temple to Kukulkan. During the spring and fall equinoxes the
    shadow cast by the angle of the sun and edges of the nine steps of the pyramid
    combined with the northern stairway and the stone serpent head carvings create
    the illusion of a massive serpent descending the pyramid.\r\nAfter the fall of
    Chichen Itza, the nearby Postclassic city of Mayapan became the centre of the
    revived Kukulkan worshipers, with temples decorated with feathered serpent columns.
    At the time of the Spanish colonization, the high priest of Kukulkan was the
    family patriarch of the Xiu faction and was one of the two most powerful men
    in the city.\r\nThe cult of Kukulkan spread as far as the Guatemalan Highlands,
    where Postclassic feathered serpent sculptures are found with open mouths from
    which protrude the heads of human warriors.\r"
