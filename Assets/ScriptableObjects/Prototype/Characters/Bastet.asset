  description: "Cats in ancient Egypt were highly revered, partly due to their ability
    to combat vermin such as mice, rats (which threatened key food supplies), and
    snakes\u2014especially cobras. Cats of royalty were, in some instances, known
    to be dressed in golden jewelry and were allowed to eat from the plates of their
    owners. Dennis C. Turner and Patrick Bateson estimate that during the Twenty-second
    Dynasty (c.\u2009945\u2013715 BC), Bastet worship changed from being a lioness
    deity into being predominantly a major cat deity. Because domestic cats tend
    to be tender and protective of their offspring, Bastet was also regarded as a
    good mother and sometimes was depicted with numerous kittens."
