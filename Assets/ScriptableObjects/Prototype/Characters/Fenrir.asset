  description: "Fenrir is a wolf in Norse mythology. Fenrir, together with Hel and
    the World Serpent, is a child of Loki and giantess Angrbooa. Is foretold to kill
    the god Odin during the events of Ragnar\xF6k, but will in turn be killed by
    Odin's son Vioarr.\r\nDue to the gods' knowledge of prophecies foretelling great
    trouble from Fenrir and his rapid growth, the gods bound him and as a result
    Fenrir bit off the right hand of the god Tyr. Depictions of Fenrir have been
    identified on various objects and scholarly theories have been proposed regarding
    Fenrir's relation to other canine beings in Norse mythology.\r"
